QUESTION:        Two hockey players pass a puck between them on an ice rink. Assume that the ice is very smooth so that there is no friction. What forces are acting on the puck while the puck is moving on the ice between the two players? Describe the motion of the puck. Please begin by briefly answering the above question. After briefly answering the above question, please go on to explain your answer in as much detail as you can.
ANSWER:          The puck while between the two players is moving at a constant velocity because its net force is zero and it is not at rest, so Newton's first 1st law states that it has to be moving at a constant velocity. It is not being hit and there is no friction, so only gravity and the natural force of the ice rink are acting upon the puck and they are acting down and up respectively  (only in the vertical plane) where as the puck is moving in the horizontal plane. It is in equilibrium, it moves at a constant velocity. (meaning no acceleration, constant speed, and constant direction)
CUE:             no
ANNOTATEDANSWER: It is not being hit and [there is] <<no>> [{friction}] , so only gravity and the natural force of the ice rink are acting upon the puck and they are acting down and up respectively -LRB- only in the vertical plane -RRB- where as the puck is moving in the horizontal plane .

QUESTION:        Well, if only gravity were acting on the puck vertically, the puck would not be at rest in the vertical direction but rather move with the gravitational acceleration downwards. Could you now think of the forces acting on the puck while at rest?
ANSWER:          If this is the case, then it would not be Newton's First law, rather Newton's third law of motion, where the floor and gravity are acting on the puck. According to the third law, two objects exert forces on each other, the forces are then equal in strength and opposite in direction.
CUE:             not

QUESTION:        Tim is practicing his air hockey skills by taking shots at an unguarded goal. He hits a frictionless puck so it moves very fast directly towards the goal. His little brother Sam, standing on the side of the table, quickly nudges the puck as it passes the center of the table. The nudge is perpendicular to the original path of the puck. With this kind of nudge, could the puck's new path ever be perpendicular to its original path?
ANSWER:          no because the force isnt applied to the puck but the table and assuming there is no friction the puck should continue in a straight line but not necessarily towards the goal
CUE:             not

QUESTION:        Right! Now let's see if you can answer my original question in a complete sentence. How does Newton's first law apply to the puck's motion perpendicular to the direction of the goal?
ANSWER:          In order for the puck's new path to be completely perpendicular to its original path toward the goal, the puck's component of velocity in the direction of the goal would have to change to zero. Newton's laws tells us that a component of net force in the opposite direction from the goal would be necessary to reduce the puck's component of velocity in the direction of the goal. Since we assume the ice to be frictionless and ignore air resistance, and since Sam's nudge is perpendicular to the puck's original path, there are no forces that could change the puck's component of velocity in the direction of the goal.
CUE:             no
ANNOTATEDANSWER: Since we assume the ice to be frictionless and ignore air resistance , and since Sam 's nudge is perpendicular to the puck 's original path , [there are] <<no>> [{forces}] that could change the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal .

QUESTION:        Right! What does Newton's second Law of motion say?
ANSWER:          pertains to the behavior of objects for which all existing forces are not balanced. The second law states that the acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables - the net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object. The acceleration of an object depends directly upon the net force acting upon the object, and inversely upon the mass of the object.
CUE:             not

QUESTION:        Let me try again. What can you say about the trajectory of the puck given that the net force on the puck is zero?
ANSWER:          The trajectory is not changing. It is constant, it is going in the same direction with the same trajectory as it has in since it was set in motion. It is constant along the x-axis due to the absense of forces pushing on it in that direction and still in equilibrium along the y since gravity and natural force are still balenced and it is not moving vertically. Net-force zero. the same.
CUE:             not

QUESTION:        Yes. We already assessed that: The ice cube would be moving with a straight path. What can you say about the net force on the cube after the poke?
ANSWER:          The decomposition principle says that the analyses of forces and motion along two perpendicular directions, such as horizontal and vertical, can be done independently. That is, Newton's laws can be applied in each direction separately, without affecting the analysis of the other perpendicular direction.  The plane's motion along the north-south direction can be analyzed separately from the plane's motion along the east-west direction. The result of the analysis along these two perpendicular directions is combined to determine the plane's overall path of motion.  The plane will travel in a straight line, because the combination of constant velocity components to the south and west give the plane's path a constant slope.  The plane would be moving in a straight line to the southwest, combining the plane's components of velocity to the south and to the west.
CUE:             without

QUESTION:        Two sisters are on a ledge over a deep swimming pool. Sue, the younger and smaller sister, takes a running start and goes straight off the ledge. Paulette, the older and larger sister, simply steps off the ledge at the same moment that Sue leaves the ledge. Which sister will hit the water first?
ANSWER:          The decomposition principle says that the analyses of forces and motion along two perpendicular directions, such as horizontal and vertical, can be done independently. That is, Newton's laws can be applied in each direction separately, without affecting the analysis of the other perpendicular direction.  Since the problem asks which stone will hit the water first, the only important direction for us to analyze is the vertical direction. The decomposition principle tells us that we don't really need to analyze the horizontal direction at all in this particular problem because of the question asked.  When only gravity is acting on an object it is said to be in freefall.  All objects near the surface of the earth freefall with the same constant downward acceleration regardless of mass (neglecting air resistance).  Once Sarah throws her stone, gravity is the only force acting on Sarah's stone (ignoring air resistance).  Once Billy drops his stone, gravity is the only force acting on Billy's stone (ignoring air resistance).  Thus, both stones are in freefall and have the same constant acceleration due to gravity.  Since the stones have the same constant acceleration due to gravity and are released from the same height at the same time, both stones will hit the water at the same time.
CUE:             without

QUESTION:        Two hockey players pass a puck between them on an ice rink. Assume that the ice is very smooth so that there is no friction. What forces are acting on the puck while the puck is moving on the ice between the two players? Describe the motion of the puck. Please begin by briefly answering the above question. After briefly answering the above question, please go on to explain your answer in as much detail as you can.
ANSWER:          The forces acting on the puck are the downward force of gravity, the upward normal force of the ice on the puck,and the forces the hockey players are putting on the puck when they hit it.  According to Newtons first law we know that if there is no friction, the object will go at a constant speed and velocity forever.  So, since there is no friction, we know that the puck would travel forever if the opposing hockey player did not change the direction of the force.
CUE:             no
ANNOTATEDANSWER: According to Newton s first law we know that if [there is] <<no>> [{friction}] , the object will go at a constant speed and velocity forever .

QUESTION:        How does the decomposition principle apply to this situation?
ANSWER:          Because The decomposition principle says that the analyses of forces and motion along two perpendicular directions, such as horizontal and vertical, can be done independently. That is, Newton's laws can be applied in each direction separately, without affecting the analysis of the other perpendicular direction.
CUE:             without
ANNOTATEDANSWER: That is , Newton 's laws can be applied in each direction separately , <<without>> [{affecting} the analysis of the other perpendicular direction] .

QUESTION:        Remember that tension and downward force of gravity are both vectors. In order for two vectors to be equal, the magnitude and the direction have to be the same. In this case, the tension is upward and gravity is downward. The MAGNITUDES of these vectors can be equal, but the vectors cannot be equal. What can you say about the amounts of the tension in the rope pulling the child and the force of gravity pulling the child downwards?
ANSWER:          The amounts of tension have to be greater than the force of gravity, even thought they are in opposite directions. Otherwise, the child would not have been able to be lifted up.
CUE:             not
ANNOTATEDANSWER: Otherwise , [the child would] <<not>> [have {been able} to be lifted up] .

QUESTION:        Can you state a relevant definition or principle?
ANSWER:          the decomposition principle states that the analyses of forces and motion along two perpendicular directions, such as horizontal and vertical, can be done independently. That is, Newton's laws can be applied in each direction separately, without affecting the analysis of the other perpendicular direction.

QUESTION:        Yes. We already assessed that: The second law is relevant because the problem describes a non-zero NET force, which is the push from the rocket, being applied on an object, which is the meteor in this case. What does Newton's second law say about net force, mass, and acceleration?
ANSWER:          I'm sorry, you really should explain the questions more thoroughly because I honestly haven't understood the question twice so far and we are only 5 minutes in.. Acceleration is directly parallel and proportional to the force put on an object.  That force is acting in a certain direction and is, rather than directly, inversely proportional to the mass of the object.

QUESTION:        This analysis would be true if we were including the period of time when the puck is touching the hockey stick. The hockey stick would exert a force on the puck causing it to accelerate. For this problem, however, restrict your analysis to only the part of the motion where the puck is between the two players (not touching them). How does Newton's first law apply to this situation?
ANSWER:          The puck remains at a constant velocity because it is not acted upon by an outside force

QUESTION:        Two hockey players pass a puck between them on an ice rink. Assume that the ice is very smooth so that there is no friction. What forces are acting on the puck while the puck is moving on the ice between the two players? Describe the motion of the puck. Please begin by briefly answering the above question. After briefly answering the above question, please go on to explain your answer in as much detail as you can.
ANSWER:          The puck while between the two players is moving at a constant velocity because its net force is zero and it is not at rest, so Newton's first 1st law states that it has to be moving at a constant velocity. It is not being hit and there is no friction, so only gravity and the natural force of the ice rink are acting upon the puck and they are acting down and up respectively  (only in the vertical plane) where as the puck is moving in the horizontal plane. It is in equilibrium, it moves at a constant velocity. (meaning no acceleration, constant speed, and constant direction)
CUE:             no
ANNOTATEDANSWER: It is not being hit and [there is] <<no>> [{friction}] , so only gravity and the natural force of the ice rink are acting upon the puck and they are acting down and up respectively -LRB- only in the vertical plane -RRB- where as the puck is moving in the horizontal plane .

QUESTION:        Let me ask the previous question again and try it one more time for a more accurate answer.
ANSWER:          Newton's first law says that if the net force on an object is ZERO the object is either AT REST (zero velocity) OR moves with a CONSTANT velocity in a STRAIGHT LINE.  Zero net force could be the result of no force at all acting on an object or the result of BALANCED forces (balanced forces cancel each other out by acting in opposite directions).
CUE:             no
ANNOTATEDANSWER: [Zero net force could be the result of] <<no>> [{force} at all acting on an object or the result of BALANCED forces] -LRB- balanced forces cancel each other out by acting in opposite directions -RRB- .

QUESTION:        Can you articulate Newton's first law?
ANSWER:          If an object experiences no net force, then its velocity is constant: the object is either at rest (if its velocity is zero), or it moves in a straight line with constant speed (if its velocity is nonzero)
CUE:             no
ANNOTATEDANSWER: [If an object experiences] <<no>> [{net force}] , then its velocity is constant : the object is either at rest -LRB- if its velocity is zero -RRB- , or it moves in a straight line with constant speed -LRB- if its velocity is nonzero -RRB-

QUESTION:        Why is the decomposition principle relevant to the motion of the apple after it leaves Susan's hand?
ANSWER:          Whether the quarter lands in Chris's hand depends on the relative horizontal motions of the quarter and Chris's hand.  The decomposition principle tells us that the vertical direction is not relevant to the analysis of horizontal motion.  Thus, no analysis of the vertical direction is needed to answer the question.

QUESTION:        Remember that tension and downward force of gravity are both vectors. In order for two vectors to be equal, the magnitude and the direction have to be the same. In this case, the tension is upward and gravity is downward. The MAGNITUDES of these vectors can be equal, but the vectors cannot be equal. How does Newton's first law apply to the piano being lowered down with constant speed?
ANSWER:          if the forces acting upon an object are balanced, then the acceleration of that object will be 0 m/s/s. Objects at equilibrium (the condition in which all forces balance) will not accelerate. According to Newton, an object will only accelerate if there is a net or unbalanced force acting upon it. The presence of an unbalanced force will accelerate an object - changing its speed, its direction, or both its speed and direction.
CUE:             not

QUESTION:        A rocket pushes a meteor with constant force. Assume that the meteor is initially at rest and is far enough away from the sun and the planets to neglect gravity. How will the meteor move? Please begin by briefly answering the above question. After briefly answering the above question, please go on to explain your answer in as much detail as you can.
ANSWER:          The meteor will move in the same direction that it is pushed at a constant speed, because, since it is in space and we neglect the force of gravity, that means that there are no other forces to act on the meteor allowing it to move at a constant speed in the same direction.

QUESTION:        Yes. We already assessed that: The second law is relevant because the problem describes a non-zero NET force, which is the push from the rocket, being applied on an object, which is the meteor in this case. What does Newton's second law say about net force, mass, and acceleration?
ANSWER:          I'm sorry, you really should explain the questions more thoroughly because I honestly haven't understood the question twice so far and we are only 5 minutes in.. Acceleration is directly parallel and proportional to the force put on an object.  That force is acting in a certain direction and is, rather than directly, inversely proportional to the mass of the object.

QUESTION:        Let me try again. What can you say about the trajectory of the puck given that the net force on the puck is zero?
ANSWER:          The trajectory is not changing. It is constant, it is going in the same direction with the same trajectory as it has in since it was set in motion. It is constant along the x-axis due to the absense of forces pushing on it in that direction and still in equilibrium along the y since gravity and natural force are still balenced and it is not moving vertically. Net-force zero. the same.

QUESTION:        Yes. We already assessed that: The second law is relevant because the problem describes a non-zero NET force, which is the push from the rocket, being applied on an object, which is the meteor in this case. What does Newton's second law say about net force, mass, and acceleration?
ANSWER:          I'm sorry, you really should explain the questions more thoroughly because I honestly haven't understood the question twice so far and we are only 5 minutes in.. Acceleration is directly parallel and proportional to the force put on an object.  That force is acting in a certain direction and is, rather than directly, inversely proportional to the mass of the object.
CUE:             n't
ANNOTATEDANSWER: I 'm sorry , you really should explain the questions more thoroughly because [I honestly have] <<n't>> [{understood} the question twice so far] and we are only 5 minutes in . .

QUESTION:        Remember that tension and downward force of gravity are both vectors. In order for two vectors to be equal, the magnitude and the direction have to be the same. In this case, the tension is upward and gravity is downward. The MAGNITUDES of these vectors can be equal, but the vectors cannot be equal. What can you say about the amounts of the tension in the rope pulling the child and the force of gravity pulling the child downwards?
ANSWER:          The amounts of tension have to be greater than the force of gravity, even thought they are in opposite directions. Otherwise, the child would not have been able to be lifted up.

ANSWER:          The trajectory is not changing. It is constant, it is going in the same direction with the same trajectory as it has in since it was set in motion. It is constant along the x-axis due to the absense of forces pushing on it in that direction and still in equilibrium along the y since gravity and natural force are still balenced and it is not moving vertically. Net-force zero. the same.

QUESTION:        The hockey stick/player can only exert a force on the puck while the puck is in contact with the stick. When the puck is moving between the two players, it is not touching the hockey sticks, so the force from the sticks is not acting on the puck during that time. How does Newton's first law apply to this situation?
ANSWER:          Newton's first law says the the puck at rest will remain at rest and when the puck is in motion will remain in motion in a straight line at a constant velocity unless there is an unbalanced force acting on it such as the hockey stick which exerts a force on the puck while the puck is in contact with the stick. When the stick is no longer in contact with the puck, the puck slows down.
CUE:             no longer
ANNOTATEDANSWER: When [the stick is] <<no longer >> [{in contact} with the puck] , the puck slows down .

QUESTION:        A mover pushes a desk with constant velocity v0 across a carpeted floor. Suddenly, the mover stops pushing. What can you say about the motion of the desk after the mover stops pushing? Explain why. Please begin by briefly answering the above question. After briefly answering the above question, please go on to explain your answer in as much detail as you can.
ANSWER:          The motion of the desk is zero.If an object experiences no net force, then its velocity is constant: the object is either at rest (if its velocity is zero), or it moves in a straight line with constant speed (if its velocity is nonzero)
CUE:             no
ANNOTATEDANSWER: [If an object experiences] <<no>> [{net force}] , then its velocity is constant : the object is either at rest -LRB- if its velocity is zero -RRB- , or it moves in a straight line with constant speed -LRB- if its velocity is nonzero -RRB-

ANSWER:          The decomposition principle says that the analyses of forces and motion along two perpendicular directions, such as horizontal and vertical, are independent. That is, Newton's laws of motion can be applied in each direction without affecting the analysis on the other perpendicular direction.

QUESTION:        Tim is practicing his air hockey skills by taking shots at an unguarded goal. He hits a frictionless puck so it moves very fast directly towards the goal. His little brother Sam, standing on the side of the table, quickly nudges the puck as it passes the center of the table. The nudge is perpendicular to the original path of the puck. With this kind of nudge, [could the puck's new path ever be {perpendicular} to its original path]?
ANSWER:          No, because the original horizontal velocity must be cancelled in order to produce a perpendicular motion.
CUE:             No
ANNOTATEDANSWER: <<No>> , because the original horizontal velocity must be canceled in order to produce a perpendicular motion .

QUESTION:        In order for the puck's new path to be completely perpendicular to its original path toward the goal, the puck's component of velocity in the direction of the goal would have to change to zero. Newton's laws tells us that a component of net force in the opposite direction from the goal would be necessary to reduce the puck's component of velocity in the direction of the goal. Since we assume the ice to be frictionless and ignore air resistance, and since Sam's nudge is perpendicular to the puck's original path, there are no forces that could change the puck's component of velocity in the direction of the goal. How does the decomposition principle apply to this situation?

QUESTION:        In order for the puck's new path to be completely perpendicular to its original path toward the goal, the puck's component of velocity in the direction of the goal would have to change to zero. Newton's laws tells us that a component of net force in the opposite direction from the goal would be necessary to reduce the puck's component of velocity in the direction of the goal. Since we assume the ice to be frictionless and ignore air resistance, and since Sam's nudge is perpendicular to the puck's original path, there are no forces that could change the puck's component of velocity in the direction of the goal. How does the decomposition principle apply to this situation?
ANSWER:          Sam's nudge is perpendicular, so it could not affect the puck's initial motion.
CUE:             not
ANNOTATEDANSWER: Sam 's nudge is perpendicular , [so it could] <<not>> [{affect} the puck 's initial motion] .

QUESTION:        A hockey puck rests in the middle of an ice rink. What forces are acting on the puck? Please begin by briefly answering the above question. Then, please go on to explain your answer in as much detail as you can using Physics concepts and principles.
ANSWER:          The force of gravity and the normal force are acting on the puck. Since, we assume, the ice rink is on Earth, there is a force of gravity acting on it. Because the puck is at rest, that means there must be a force countering the force of gravity, which is the normal force of the rink acting on the puck. Since the puck is at rest, this means there are no horizontal forces acting on it. So, only the force of gravity and the normal force act on the puck.
CUE:             no
ANNOTATEDANSWER: Since the puck is at rest , this means [there are] <<no>> [{horizontal forces} acting on it] .

QUESTION:        Why is the decomposition principle relevant to the motion of the apple after it leaves Susan's hand?
ANSWER:          Whether the quarter lands in Chris's hand depends on the relative horizontal motions of the quarter and Chris's hand.  The decomposition principle tells us that the vertical direction is not relevant to the analysis of horizontal motion.  Thus, no analysis of the vertical direction is needed to answer the question.

QUESTION:        Tim is practicing his air hockey skills by taking shots at an unguarded goal. He hits a frictionless puck so it moves very fast directly towards the goal. His little brother Sam, standing on the side of the table, quickly nudges the puck as it passes the center of the table. The nudge is perpendicular to the original path of the puck. With this kind of nudge, could the puck's new path ever be perpendicular to its original path?
ANSWER:          no because the force isnt applied to the puck but the table and assuming there is no friction the puck should continue in a straight line but not necessarily towards the goal
CUE:             not

QUESTION:        Right! Now let's see if you can answer my original question in a complete sentence. How does Newton's first law apply to the puck's motion perpendicular to the direction of the goal?
ANSWER:          In order for the puck's new path to be completely perpendicular to its original path toward the goal, the puck's component of velocity in the direction of the goal would have to change to zero. Newton's laws tells us that a component of net force in the opposite direction from the goal would be necessary to reduce the puck's component of velocity in the direction of the goal. Since we assume the ice to be frictionless and ignore air resistance, and since Sam's nudge is perpendicular to the puck's original path, there are no forces that could change the puck's component of velocity in the direction of the goal.
CUE:             no

QUESTION:        A hockey puck rests in the middle of an ice rink. What forces are acting on the puck? Please begin by briefly answering the above question. Then, please go on to explain your answer in as much detail as you can using Physics concepts and principles.
ANSWER:          The force of gravity and the normal force are acting on the puck. Since, we assume, the ice rink is on Earth, there is a force of gravity acting on it. Because the puck is at rest, that means there must be a force countering the force of gravity, which is the normal force of the rink acting on the puck. Since the puck is at rest, this means there are no horizontal forces acting on it. So, only the force of gravity and the normal force act on the puck.
CUE:             no
ANNOTATEDANSWER: Since the puck is at rest , this means [there are] <<no>> [{horizontal forces} acting on it] .

QUESTION:        Tim is practicing his air hockey skills by taking shots at an unguarded goal. He hits a frictionless puck so it moves very fast directly towards the goal. His little brother Sam, standing on the side of the table, quickly nudges the puck as it passes the center of the table. The nudge is perpendicular to the original path of the puck. With this kind of nudge, [could the puck's new path ever be {perpendicular} to its original path]?
ANSWER:          No, because the original horizontal velocity must be cancelled in order to produce a perpendicular motion.
CUE:             No

QUESTION:        How does the decomposition principle apply to this situation?
ANSWER:          The decomposition principle says that the analyses of forces and motion along two perpendicular directions, such as horizontal and vertical, can be done independently. That is, Newton's laws can be applied in each direction separately, without affecting the analysis of the other perpendicular direction.  Whether the quarter lands in Chris's hand depends on the relative horizontal motions of the quarter and Chris's hand.  The decomposition principle tells us that the vertical direction is not relevant to the analysis of horizontal motion.  Thus, no analysis of the vertical direction is needed to answer the question.  The wagon, Chris, Chris's hand, and the quarter all have the same constant horizontal component of velocity both before and after the throw.  The quarter and Chris's relative horizontal positions are identical as they have all the time equal horizontal velocities and start at the same position initially, at the moment of the throw.  Since Chris's hand and the quarter travel equal horizontal distances in equal times, the quarter will land in Chris's hand
CUE:             not
ANNOTATEDANSWER: The decomposition principle tells us that [the vertical direction is] <<not>> [{relevant} to the analysis of horizontal motion] .

QUESTION:        Remember that tension and downward force of gravity are both vectors. In order for two vectors to be equal, the magnitude and the direction have to be the same. In this case, the tension is upward and gravity is downward. The MAGNITUDES of these vectors can be equal, but the vectors cannot be equal. What can you say about the amounts of the tension in the rope pulling the child and the force of gravity pulling the child downwards?
ANSWER:          The amounts of tension have to be greater than the force of gravity, even thought they are in opposite directions. Otherwise, the child would not have been able to be lifted up.

QUESTION:        How can you apply Newton's 1st law to the parachutist?
ANSWER:          the net force on an object is ZERO the object is either AT REST (zero velocity) OR moves with a CONSTANT velocity in a STRAIGHT LINE. Zero net force could be the result of no force at all acting on an object or the result of BALANCED forces (balanced forces cancel each other out by acting in opposite directions).
CUE:             no
ANNOTATEDANSWER: Zero net force could be the result of <<no>> [{force} at all acting on an object] or the result of BALANCED forces -LRB- balanced forces cancel each other out by acting in opposite directions -RRB- .

QUESTION:        A rocket pushes a meteor with constant force. Assume that the meteor is initially at rest and is far enough away from the sun and the planets to neglect gravity. How will the meteor move? Please begin by briefly answering the above question. After briefly answering the above question, please go on to explain your answer in as much detail as you can.
ANSWER:          The object will continue to accelerate as long as the rocket provides the constant force.  Newton's first law states that an object that moves at a constant velocity has no net force, therefore we know that it cannot be moving at a constant velocity, and because of the continous force of the rocket that the meteor will accelerate.

QUESTION:        Tim is practicing his air hockey skills by taking shots at an unguarded goal. He hits a frictionless puck so it moves very fast directly towards the goal. His little brother Sam, standing on the side of the table, quickly nudges the puck as it passes the center of the table. The nudge is perpendicular to the original path of the puck. With this kind of nudge, could the puck's new path ever be perpendicular to its original path?
ANSWER:          no because the force isnt applied to the puck but the table and assuming there is no friction the puck should continue in a straight line but not necessarily towards the goal
CUE:             not
ANNOTATEDANSWER: no because the force isnt applied to the puck but the table and assuming there is no friction the puck should continue in a straight line but <<not>> [necessarily {towards} the goal]

QUESTION:        Remember that tension and downward force of gravity are both vectors. In order for two vectors to be equal, the magnitude and the direction have to be the same. In this case, the tension is upward and gravity is downward. The MAGNITUDES of these vectors can be equal, but the vectors cannot be equal. How does Newton's first law apply to the piano being lowered down with constant speed?
ANSWER:          if the forces acting upon an object are balanced, then the acceleration of that object will be 0 m/s/s. Objects at equilibrium (the condition in which all forces balance) will not accelerate. According to Newton, an object will only accelerate if there is a net or unbalanced force acting upon it. The presence of an unbalanced force will accelerate an object - changing its speed, its direction, or both its speed and direction.
CUE:             not

QUESTION:        Let me try again. What can you say about the trajectory of the puck given that the net force on the puck is zero?
ANSWER:          The trajectory is not changing. It is constant, it is going in the same direction with the same trajectory as it has in since it was set in motion. It is constant along the x-axis due to the absense of forces pushing on it in that direction and still in equilibrium along the y since gravity and natural force are still balenced and it is not moving vertically. Net-force zero. the same.
CUE:             absense
ANNOTATEDANSWER: It is constant along the x-axis due to the <<absense>> [of {forces} pushing on it in that direction] and still in equilibrium along the y since gravity and natural force are still balenced and it is not moving vertically .

QUESTION:        In order for the puck's new path to be completely perpendicular to its original path toward the goal, the puck's component of velocity in the direction of the goal would have to change to zero. Newton's laws tells us that a component of net force in the opposite direction from the goal would be necessary to reduce the puck's component of velocity in the direction of the goal. Since we assume the ice to be frictionless and ignore air resistance, and since Sam's nudge is perpendicular to the puck's original path, there are no forces that could change the puck's component of velocity in the direction of the goal. How does the decomposition principle apply to this situation?

QUESTION:        Let me ask the previous question again and try it one more time for a more accurate answer.
ANSWER:          Newton's first law says that if the net force on an object is ZERO the object is either AT REST (zero velocity) OR moves with a CONSTANT velocity in a STRAIGHT LINE.  Zero net force could be the result of no force at all acting on an object or the result of BALANCED forces (balanced forces cancel each other out by acting in opposite directions).
CUE:             no
ANNOTATEDANSWER: [Zero net force could be the result of] <<no>> [{force} at all acting on an object or the result of BALANCED forces] -LRB- balanced forces cancel each other out by acting in opposite directions -RRB- .

QUESTION:        Why is the decomposition principle relevant to the motion of the apple after it leaves Susan's hand?
ANSWER:          Whether the quarter lands in Chris's hand depends on the relative horizontal motions of the quarter and Chris's hand.  The decomposition principle tells us that the vertical direction is not relevant to the analysis of horizontal motion.  Thus, no analysis of the vertical direction is needed to answer the question.
CUE:             no
ANNOTATEDANSWER: Thus , <<no>> [{analysis} of the vertical direction is needed to answer the question].

QUESTION:        How does Newton's first law apply to the puck's motion in the direction of the goal?
ANSWER:          Newton's laws tells us that a component of net force in the opposite direction from the goal would be necessary to reduce the puck's component of velocity in the direction of the goal. Since we assume the ice to be frictionless and ignore air resistance, and since Sam's nudge is perpendicular to the puck's original path, there are no forces that could change the puck's component of velocity in the direction of the goal.
CUE:             no
ANNOTATEDANSWER: Since we assume the ice to be frictionless and ignore air resistance , and since Sam 's nudge is perpendicular to the puck 's original path , [there are] <<no>> [{forces} that could change the puck 's component of velocity in the direction of the goal] .

QUESTION:        A rocket pushes a meteor with constant force. Assume that the meteor is initially at rest and is far enough away from the sun and the planets to neglect gravity. How will the meteor move? Please begin by briefly answering the above question. After briefly answering the above question, please go on to explain your answer in as much detail as you can.
ANSWER:          The meteor will move in the same direction that it is pushed at a constant speed, because, since it is in space and we neglect the force of gravity, that means that there are no other forces to act on the meteor allowing it to move at a constant speed in the same direction.

QUESTION:        Maybe. What does Newton's first law say about an object's motion and net force?
ANSWER:          If an object experiences no net force, then its velocity is constant: the object is either at rest (if its velocity is zero), or it moves in a straight line with constant speed (if its velocity is nonzero)
CUE:             no
ANNOTATEDANSWER: If [an object experiences] <<no>> [{net force}] , then its velocity is constant : the object is either at rest -LRB- if its velocity is zero -RRB- , or it moves in a straight line with constant speed -LRB- if its velocity is nonzero -RRB-

QUESTION:        Yes. We already assessed that: The ice cube would be moving with a straight path. What can you say about the net force on the cube after the poke?
ANSWER:          The decomposition principle says that the analyses of forces and motion along two perpendicular directions, such as horizontal and vertical, can be done independently. That is, Newton's laws can be applied in each direction separately, without affecting the analysis of the other perpendicular direction.  The plane's motion along the north-south direction can be analyzed separately from the plane's motion along the east-west direction. The result of the analysis along these two perpendicular directions is combined to determine the plane's overall path of motion.  The plane will travel in a straight line, because the combination of constant velocity components to the south and west give the plane's path a constant slope.  The plane would be moving in a straight line to the southwest, combining the plane's components of velocity to the south and to the west.

QUESTION:        The hockey stick/player can only exert a force on the puck while the puck is in contact with the stick. When the puck is moving between the two players, it is not touching the hockey sticks, so the force from the sticks is not acting on the puck during that time. How does Newton's first law apply to this situation?
ANSWER:          Newton's first law says the the puck at rest will remain at rest and when the puck is in motion will remain in motion in a straight line at a constant velocity unless there is an unbalanced force acting on it such as the hockey stick which exerts a force on the puck while the puck is in contact with the stick. When the stick is no longer in contact with the puck, the puck slows down.
CUE:             no longer
ANNOTATEDANSWER: When [the stick is] <<no longer >> [{in contact} with the puck] , the puck slows down .

QUESTION:        Yes. We already assessed that: The second law is relevant because the problem describes a non-zero NET force, which is the push from the rocket, being applied on an object, which is the meteor in this case. What does Newton's second law say about net force, mass, and acceleration?
ANSWER:          I'm sorry, you really should explain the questions more thoroughly because I honestly haven't understood the question twice so far and we are only 5 minutes in.. Acceleration is directly parallel and proportional to the force put on an object.  That force is acting in a certain direction and is, rather than directly, inversely proportional to the mass of the object.

QUESTION:        Chris is sitting in a wagon at rest with a quarter in his hand. He closes his eyes and throws the quarter upward. After a while, the quarter lands back in his hand without Chris opening his eyes. If Chris tried the same trick by throwing the quarter in the exact same way while the wagon was moving at a constant velocity, would the quarter land in his hand? Please begin by briefly answering the above question. After briefly answering the above question, please go on to explain your answer in as much detail as you can.
ANSWER:          The quarter would not land back into his hand because the quarter would only have upwards velocity and then gravity acting upon it and would land directly below where Chris' hand was previously. Since Chris and the wagon are moving horizontally forward, the coin would not land in his hand
CUE:             not
ANNOTATEDANSWER: [The quarter would] <<not>> [land back {into his hand}] because the quarter would only have upwards velocity and then gravity acting upon it and would land directly below where Chris ' hand was previously .
